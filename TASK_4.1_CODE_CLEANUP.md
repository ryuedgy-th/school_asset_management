# Task 4.1: Remove Obsolete Files and Clean Up Data - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objective
Clean up the codebase by removing obsolete files, fixing placeholder data, and correcting access rights to improve code quality and maintainability.

## ✅ What Was Done

### PART 1: Remove Obsolete Files ✅

#### Files Removed:
1. ✅ `reports/inspection_damage_report_old.xml` (obsolete report template)
2. ✅ `reports/signed_damage_report_old.xml` (obsolete report template)
3. ✅ `static/src/js/teacher_damage_signature_pad.js.backup-20251014-093727` (backup file)

**Command Used:**
```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*_old.xml" -o -name "*.backup" -o -name "*.backup-*" \) 2>/dev/null
rm -v ./reports/inspection_damage_report_old.xml ./reports/signed_damage_report_old.xml ./static/src/js/teacher_damage_signature_pad.js.backup-20251014-093727
```

**Result:** Removed 3 obsolete files

**Status:** ✅ These files were NOT referenced in __manifest__.py, so no manifest updates needed

---

### PART 2: Fix Placeholder Data ✅

#### File: `templates/privacy_consent.xml`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Removed placeholder phone numbers:**
   - Before: `+66-XXX-XXX-XXXX` (10 occurrences)
   - After: `[Contact school administration]` or removed entirely

2. **Improved address placeholder:**
   - Before: `[ระบุที่อยู่โรงเรียน]`
   - After: `[Contact school administration for address]`

3. **Kept valid email addresses:**
   - ✅ `dpo@myis.ac.th` (Data Protection Officer)
   - ✅ `it@myis.ac.th` (IT Department)

**Total Changes:** 10 placeholder replacements

**Reasoning:**
- Real phone numbers should be configured during deployment
- Using generic placeholders is better than fake numbers
- Email addresses follow standard naming convention and are valid

---

### PART 3: Fix Access Rights ✅

#### File: `security/ir.model.access.csv`

**Issue:** Dashboard model had incorrect permissions (create/write/unlink = 1)

**Changes Made:**

| Access Rule | Model | Before (R,W,C,U) | After (R,W,C,U) | Change |
|-------------|-------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| `access_asset_dashboard_manager` | `model_asset_dashboard` | `1,1,1,1` | `1,0,0,0` | Read-only |
| `access_asset_dashboard_user` | `model_asset_dashboard` | `1,1,1,1` | `1,0,0,0` | Read-only |
| `access_asset_dashboard_teacher` | `model_asset_dashboard` | `1,1,1,1` | `1,0,0,0` | Read-only |

**Reasoning:**
- Dashboard is a **computed view** (not a stored model)
- Users should only be able to **read** dashboard data
- Create/Write/Unlink operations don't make sense for computed views
- Prevents potential security issues from unnecessary permissions

**Impact:**
- ✅ Improved security
- ✅ Follows Odoo best practices
- ✅ Prevents accidental data corruption

---

### PART 4: Check TODO/FIXME Comments ✅

**Command Used:**
```bash
grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME" --include="*.py" --include="*.xml" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null
```

**Result:** ✅ **No TODO or FIXME comments found**

All previously identified TODOs have been completed in earlier tasks:
- ✅ Email templates (Task 2.3)
- ✅ Token security (Task 2.1)
- ✅ Font bundling (Task 3.1)

---

### PART 5: Update __manifest__.py ✅

**Version Bump:**
- Before: `19.0.1.9.0`
- After: `19.0.1.10.0`

**No file references to remove:**
- ✅ Obsolete files were not referenced in __manifest__.py
- ✅ No changes needed to 'data' list

---

## 📊 Summary Statistics

| Category | Count | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Files Removed** | 3 | 2 XML reports + 1 JS backup |
| **Placeholder Fixes** | 10 | Phone numbers and addresses |
| **Access Rights Fixed** | 3 | Dashboard permissions (all user groups) |
| **TODO/FIXME Remaining** | 0 | All completed |
| **Version Bump** | 1 | 19.0.1.9.0 → 19.0.1.10.0 |

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### 1. Files to Sync to Production

```bash
# Modified files
scp -i ~/.ssh/RyusOpen templates/privacy_consent.xml \
  root@128.199.203.205:/opt/odoo19/custom_addons/school_asset_management/templates/

scp -i ~/.ssh/RyusOpen security/ir.model.access.csv \
  root@128.199.203.205:/opt/odoo19/custom_addons/school_asset_management/security/

scp -i ~/.ssh/RyusOpen __manifest__.py \

```

### 2. Remove Obsolete Files from Production

```bash
# SSH into production server
ssh -i ~/.ssh/RyusOpen root@128.199.203.205

# Navigate to module directory
cd /opt/odoo19/custom_addons/school_asset_management/

# Remove obsolete files
rm -v reports/inspection_damage_report_old.xml \
      reports/signed_damage_report_old.xml \

```

### 3. Upgrade Module

```bash
# Via Odoo UI:
Apps > School Asset Management > Upgrade
```

### 4. Verify Changes

1. **Check Dashboard Permissions:**
   - Try to create a dashboard record (should fail)
   - Verify read access works

2. **Check Privacy Consent:**
   - Open student checkout signature page
